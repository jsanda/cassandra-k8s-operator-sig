The purpose of this repo is capture design ideas and proposals in an effort to move forward with a community based operator for Cassandra. There is a special interest group (SIG) that meets bi-weekly. You can find details on the SIG [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/Cassandra+Kubernetes+Operator+SIG).

* [Orange's CassKop](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/casskop)
* [Sky UK Cassandra Operator](https://github.com/sky-uk/cassandra-operator)
